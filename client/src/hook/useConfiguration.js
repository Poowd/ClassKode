              <h6>Scheduling System</h6>
              <p>
                A scheduling system is a software application designed to manage
                and organize the allocation of time slots for classes, exams,
                and other events within an educational institution. It automates
                the process of creating, modifying, and optimizing schedules,
                ensuring that resources such as classrooms and instructors are
                effectively utilized. By employing algorithms, such as genetic
                algorithms, these systems can handle complex scheduling
                scenarios, detect conflicts, and provide flexible options for
                users.

              <h6>Faculty Locator</h6>
              <p>
                A faculty locator is a tool that helps students and staff
                identify the locations and availability of faculty members
                within an institution. This system typically includes a database
                of faculty profiles, which may contain information such as
                names, departments, images, and current status (e.g., available,
                in a meeting). The faculty locator enhances communication and
                accessibility, allowing students to easily find and connect with
                their instructors.

                    Educational institutions often face constraints in terms of
                    available classrooms, faculty, and time. A scheduling system
                    helps optimize the use of these limited resources, ensuring
                    that classes and exams are scheduled in a way that minimizes
                    conflicts and maximizes occupancy.

                    In areas where faculty members may be spread across multiple
                    locations or campuses, a faculty locator provides essential
                    information that helps students find their instructors
                    quickly. This is particularly important in resource-limited
                    settings where personal interactions may be less frequent.
